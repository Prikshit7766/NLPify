• Developed a sophisticated AI platform that extracts various NLP features, including sentiment analysis, named
entity recognition, and text summarization, from app review data.
• Performed extensive data preprocessing using techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, and vectorization to
transform the raw data into a machinereadable format.
• Created a Binary classification model using logistic regression and a text vectorization pipeline to predict
sentiment, and deployed the platform as a user-friendly web app using the Streamlit framework.
